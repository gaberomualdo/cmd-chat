# cmdchat
A simple live chat application with a terminal-like theme. Previously called livechat.
On cmdchat, you can chat on different chat hashes. For example, the default chat hash is "chat," which is found at https://xtrp.github.io/cmdchat/#chat.
Each chat hash is it's own separate chat, which can be accessed by changing what follows the hashtag at the end of the URL.
For example, if you want to chat with your friends, you can come up with a code that is your chat hash, eg. 57423, which would be at https://xtrp.github.io/cmdchat/#57423.
Then, if you and your friends know the correct chat hash, only you and your friends can talk on that chat.
