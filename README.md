# cmdchat: a simple chat service
## a simple live chat application with a terminal-like theme.

chat on different chatrooms by changing the hash in the URL.
for example https://xtrp.github.io/cmdchat/#chat would link to the #chat chatroom, because the end of the URL is #chat.
you can chat on whatever chatroom you want, just by changing the hash on the URL.
you can think of the chatroom hash as a pin for a new chat.

you can also do special commands on the chat.
for example, you can type ```/clear``` to clear the entire chat and essentially restart the chat.

so, why not start using cmdchat?
just type https://xtrp.github.io/cmdchat/# then your chatroom hash, and start chatting!
